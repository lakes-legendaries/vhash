VHash: Vectorizing Hash Tables
##############################

If you have documents with class labels, and you want to create numeric
representations of those documents that maximize inter-class differences, then
this package is for you. This package provides vectorizing hash tables that
quickly transform your text, optimizing for the maximum distance between
document-class vectors.
